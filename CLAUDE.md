## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Heap Out of Memory Error
If you encounter memory issues while running the application:
```bash
# Set environment variable before running commands
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Or run directly with the flag
node --max-old-space-size=4096 your-script.js
```

### Database Migration Failures
If migrations fail with "migrate found failed migrations" error:
1. Run the repair script: `pnpm db:repair`
2. Then run migrations again: `pnpm db:migrate`

### API 500 Errors
Common causes and fixes:
- Missing relations in Prisma queries - ensure all referenced relations are included
- Missing fields in database - run `pnpm db:push` to sync schema
- Authentication issues - verify JWT token is valid

## Known Issues
- Git config shows committer email as local machine - configure with `git config --global --edit`
