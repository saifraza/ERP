To use the MSPIL logo in the RFQ header, please:

1. Convert the PDF logo to PNG or JPG format using any online converter or tool
2. Place the converted image in: apps/cloud-api/public/mspil-logo.png
3. Or upload it to a cloud service and use the URL

For now, the RFQ header includes:
- A white circular logo placeholder with "MSPIL" text
- The company name and details beside it
- Green background (#b4d04a) matching your letterhead

The header will look professional even without the actual logo image.
