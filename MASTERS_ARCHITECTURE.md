# Master Data Architecture for Multi-Factory ERP

## Overview
This document outlines the master data architecture designed to support multi-company, multi-factory deployment of the ERP system with full Indian finance law compliance.

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Multi-Tenancy Support
- **Company Level**: Top-level segregation for multiple companies
- **Factory Level**: Sub-level segregation within each company
- **User Access**: Role-based access control per company/factory
- **Data Isolation**: Complete data separation between companies

### 2. Hierarchical Structure
```
Company (Top Level)
├── Factories/Plants
├── Users & Roles
├── Fiscal Years
└── Master Data
    ├── Material Master (Global)
    ├── Vendor/Customer Master
    ├── Chart of Accounts
    └── Tax Masters
```

### 3. Indian Compliance Built-in
- GST structure (CGST, SGST, IGST)
- TDS/TCS management with sections
- HSN/SAC code mapping
- E-invoice readiness
- Digital signature support

## Master Tables Overview

- Local GST numbers (if different)

### 3. Material Master
**Global catalog shared across factories**
- Item codes and descriptions
- HSN codes for GST
- Multiple units of measure
- Inventory valuation methods
- Reorder levels per location

### 4. Chart of Accounts
**Hierarchical account structure**
- Assets, Liabilities, Income, Expenses
- TDS applicability flags
- GST mapping
- System accounts protection

### 5. Tax Masters
**Comprehensive tax management**

- TCS provisions
- State-specific taxes

### 6. Vendor/Customer Master
**Centralized party management**

- GST compliance checks
- Credit limits and terms
- Performance tracking
- Multi-location mapping

### 7. Approval Matrix
**Flexible workflow engine**
- Document type based
- Amount-based escalation
- Role-based routing
- Delegation support

### 8. Number Series
**Configurable numbering**

- Factory-specific prefixes
- Auto-reset options
- Fiscal year integration

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. Scalability
- Add new companies without code changes
- Easy factory addition
- Flexible user management
- Performance optimization

### 2. Compliance

## Database Design Highlights

### 1. Referential Integrity
```prisma
model Factory {
  companyId String
  company   Company @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id])
  // Ensures factory always belongs to a company
}
```

### 2. Unique Constraints
```prisma
@@unique([companyId, code])
// Ensures unique codes within company
```

### 3. Indexing Strategy
```prisma
@@index([companyId, factoryId])
@@index([materialCode])
@@index([status])
// Optimized for common queries
```

### 4. JSON Fields for Flexibility
```prisma
settings String? // JSON for dynamic configs
specifications String? // JSON for variable specs
```

## Multi-Factory Features
